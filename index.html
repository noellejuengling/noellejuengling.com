	<h1> Getting to know me</h1>

	<img src="https://scontent-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t1.0-9/1524987_10202239679296823_4682694494752137662_n.jpg">

	<p>What's up everyone, I am Noelle Juengling.  Originally from New Jersey, I have spent the past 5 years living and working in New York City. I graduated from New York Unversity with a B.S. in Communicative Science and Disorder and a minor in Media, Culture and Communication.  For the past two years I worked at a small Startup company in Brooklyn, NY where I was exposed to marketing analytics and data.  From this exerpeice my interest in comsumer data began.<p>

	<h2> What I'm all about </h2>
	
	<p> I'm a lover of the great outdoors. Climbing mountains, hiking volcanos, or sitting on beaches is where I'm the happiest. I'll never say no to an adventure that takes me somewhere new. I believe that learning about different cultures and interacting with people from all over the world is the key to life. Although I consider Costa Rica one of the most beautiful places in the world (and my second home) I'll catch a sunset anywhere in the world.<p>
